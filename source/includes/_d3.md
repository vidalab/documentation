When creating or viewing a document, this window will show. It contains 2 parts: 

* Left pane: canvas 
* Right pane: editors

## Canvas
This pane is the visual presentation of the document where it combines the code and data together. It has the following parts:

* Title: editable when clicking
* Description: editable when clicking
* Drawing: the vector drawing from the code will be placed here, and it's updated on the fly as you change the code 

## Editors
This pane allows developers to code their visualizations or quickly configure them. It has the following tabs:

* Properties: show predefined properties for quickly configure and reuse the viz
* Javascript: code editor
* Stylesheet: style editor 
* Data: data upload or quick import for different formats (CSV, TSV, JSON)
* Settings: set auto refresh, privacy, thumbnail, and get document share/embed code.

To import a visualization, please use the correct tab

* HTML
   * Additional HTML structure of a visualization
   * A div#canvas-svg is recommended 

* Javascript
  * Do not use 'select("body")' to append the svg. VIDA will automatically replace this with 'select("canvas-svg")' instead.
	* Use 'data' variable for JSON data passed from Data tab
	
* Stylesheet (CSS)
  * Styling code
  
* Data (CSV/TSV/JSON)
  * Import or cut and paste data 
  * To access, use 'data' variable in Javascript tab code

## Safe Mode
This mode is automatically set on because javascript code failed to complete evaluation/execution. Some of the reasons include: 

* being stucked in an infinite loop.
* bugs that terminate the javascript eval.
* taking too long and not finishing loading.

If this is due to bugs, you need to fix and save the code. Debugger console can be helpful.

Your code won't execute until this mode is disabled. You can disable this mode by going to Settings tab.
