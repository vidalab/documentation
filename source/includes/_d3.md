  ![alt text](./d3/d3-editor.png "Header")
</a>

This section is entirely for D3 documents only. Other types of documents may or many not have similar features. 

When creating or viewing a document, this window will show. It contains 2 parts: 

* Left pane: canvas 
* Right pane: editors

## Create New
<a href="images/d3/new-doc.png" data-lightbox="d3-document" data-title="New Document" style="display: block; float:right;">
  ![alt text](./d3/new-doc.png "New Document")
</a>

To create a new d3 document, on home screen after login go to: **D3 Documents > New Document**

This new doucment list includes two separate set of templates:

* Basic built in templates 
* User-set templates 

When creating a new document from built-in templates, a new and complete document will be created.
The last option in this list is the 'Import Github'. This feature is used to import VIDA compatible documents from GitHub. 
For VIDA compatible structure, please visit <a href='https://github.com/vidalab/document_template' target='_blank'>Vida GitHub Template</a>.

When creating a new document from user-set templates, a template child document will be created.

**Notes:** user-set templates are regular documents and must have 'No-clone' disabled in order to show up in the list.

## Top Menu
 
This is designed to have similar user experience with a desktop app. It contains the following options (left to right):
 
* Vida logo - go back home
* D3 text - d3 document editor indicator
* File menu with additional dropdown options:
  * Get Embed Code - gets embed URLs for current document
  * Delete - removes current document
  * Exit - exits current edit document to go back home
* Save - comes with a shortcut as 'Ctrl+Return'
* Clone - clones current document. When cloning a template, the newly cloned document will become a child document.
* More option (horizontal ellipsis)- allows custom view window arrangement

## Canvas
This section contains the visual presentation of the document where it combines the code, data, properties and styles together. It has three(3) different sections:

* Title: editable when selected
* Description: editable when selected
* SVG rendering space: the vector drawing from current document. This will be re-drawn upon the following triggers:
  * Save - when there's a code change and the document is being saved
  * Property change - a property change will immediately render a new SVG

**Notes:** Saving a document with no change will not trigger the re-rendering.

## Editors

This sections contains the most important data for a document including settings. It contains the following tabs:

### Settings (Ctrl+1)

This tab shows all the possible settings for a regular document

* Template switch (regular doucment) or Template detach (child document)
* Sharing - share with individuals or teams
* Privacy - allow document to be public/unlisted/private. 
    - Public - can be seen and searched by any user
    - Unlisted - cannot be searched, but can be seen to whoever has the document URL
    - Private - can only be seen by owner and shared individuals/teams
* Resource - import external javascript and stylesheet libraries. This also provides a list with some preloaded and suggested resources.
* Tags - allows documents to be searched and indexed properly
* Embed Custom Signature (PRO subscription only) when embed
    - Text
    - URL (redirect URL)
* Embed Widget switch - show/hide embed widget
* General info 
* No clone - enable/disable cloning
* Thumbnail - public image for the current document
  
### Data
<a href="images/d3/data-tab.png" data-lightbox="d3-document" data-title="New Document" style="display: block; float:right;">
  ![alt text](./d3/data-tab.png "New Document")
</a>

This tab contains a data editor. Users can choose to import data from a file. There're three (3) supported data type:

* CSV
* TSV
* JSON

Once saved, the parsed data is piped through the javascript code as 'data' variable with JSON structure. 
To better understand, one may print the structure in debug console.

This data tab has the editor shown as default. A grid can be viewed (non-editable) once data is saved first.

A d3 document can utilize a dataset document as its own data by setting a dataseting in this tab.
If a dataset is selected, all current document data will be removed. 
If a dataset is removed, the current data from dataset document is copied to the current d3 document.

### Properties
<a href="images/d3/prop-tab.png" data-lightbox="d3-document" data-title="New Document" style="display: block; float:right;">
  ![alt text](./d3/prop-tab.png "New Document")
</a>

Properties feature is one of the important feature that makes d3 documents versatile. 
By defining a document properties, the owner allow document customization and any other user can quickly clone and turn it into his needs.

There are five (5) supported types based on javascript types:

* Data Column - string type for column name parsed from data
* Number - number type
* String - string type
* Boolean - boolean type
* Color - hex string (ex: '#0C5175')

**Notes:** 

* Properties can be changed only by document owner and shared users with edit access.
* A template child cannot change its properties. They're only available for the template document.
* When a property changes, the document will be saved and re-rendering will be triggered automatically .

### Javascript
<a href="images/d3/javascript-tab.png" data-lightbox="d3-document" data-title="New Document" style="display: block; float:right;">
  ![alt text](./d3/javascript-tab.png "New Document")
</a>

Javascript code is at heart of a d3 document. This code block will be wrapped inside an anonymous function before execution.
'data' variable contains the parsed JSON from Data tab. 
'config' variable contains the properties set in Properties tab. To use properties, use config["propertyName"] or config.propertyName within the code.

A div with id 'canvas-svg' is dedicated for d3 svg rendering. 
Rendering outside this div may result unexpected behavior and UI misalignment. 

When saving a document with javascript/html/stylesheet/data changes, a re-rendering will be trigger. 
Saving a document without any change will not trigger re-rendering.

**Notes:**
* Defining any 'data' and 'config' variable internally within the code will overwrite the passing through ones.
* When cut and paste external code, the pseudo code 'select("body")' will automatically be replaced by 'select("canvas-svg")'.

### Stylesheet
<a href="images/d3/css-tab.png" data-lightbox="d3-document" data-title="New Document" style="display: block; float:right;">
  ![alt text](./d3/css-tab.png "New Document")
</a>

This editor contains the normal basic stylesheet code. 

**Notes:**
* Use class or id specific to style elements related the visualization only
* Avoid using styling that alters this webapp (Example: html, body, h1, a, etc.). Your documents may get flagged if doing so.

### HTML

This editor contains the normal basic stylesheet code. 
This code block will be within inserted inside '#canvas' div.
The d3 svg will be rendered within '#canvas-svg' which can be placed anywhere within this HTML code block.

**Notes:**
3. Do not define an html page here, i.e. including html, head, body tags.

### Readme

This editor contains markdown content for the document. This content is shown right below the document svg for its public page.

For how to write a markdown document, please visit 
<a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/" tagert="_blank"> Daring Fireball </a>

### Shortcuts

These tabs have some shortcuts that may be useful for frequent use.

* Ctrl + number (1,2,3,4,5,6) - change editor tabs
* Ctrl + Enter - save document
* Ctrl + '/' - enable/disable canvas full view

## Templates

A document can be set as a template using the Template switch in Settings tab. By setting this, any further documents that are cloned from this template will be the children. 

### Parent
<a href="images/d3/template.png" data-lightbox="d3-document" data-title="Template Document" style="display: block; float:right;">
  ![alt text](./d3/template.png "Header")
</a>

A parent template or template is a regular document. When updating a template, its javascript, html and css code will be synchronized across its children. 
Data and properties' values are unchanged within its children. Settings, data and properties are not synced across its children.

If the template mode is switched off, all of its children will be disconnected from then and any update will not change its previously children.

**Notes:**

* After the parent template is switched off, children documents are still in children mode. Users need to 'detach' them to make them fully independent.


### Child
<a href="images/d3/template-child.png" data-lightbox="d3-document" data-title="Child Document" style="display: block; float:right;">
  ![alt text](./d3/template-child.png "Header")
</a>

A child document can only apply its own settings, data set and properties. The underlying code are mirrored from its parent template. 

When the template document has changes, javascript/html/stylesheet code will be synchronized across its children. 
Thus, there're only three (3) tabs shown in a child:

* Settings
* Data
* Properties

Users may detach a child from its parent and turn it into a regular document through 'Detach' button in Settings tab.
By detaching from its parent, it will no longer receive any code update from the parent. This action is not reversible.

**Notes:**

* Properties cannot be changed through a child.
* Updating data and properties doesn't change its parent and siblings' data or properties.

## Embed & Share
<a href="images/d3/embed.png" data-lightbox="d3-document" data-title="Embed Document" style="display: block; float:right;">
  ![alt text](./d3/embed.png "Embed")
</a>

Embed feature is used to present the current visual part of the document on an external site. 
This option is available under through 

**File > Get Embed Code**

The dimensions of the embed document is automatically built into the URL if the document has width and height properties set up.

There are two (2) different URL for embedding a document:

* HTTP - HyperText Transfer Protocol (faster)
* HTTPS - Secure HTTP (slower)

The Share option is also availble within this dialog window. 
If the document is public or unlisted, anybody with the share URL will be able to see the public page of the document.
If the document is private, only owner and shared users can access the document public or edit page.

**Notes:**

* While editing a document, owner can test and view the public page through menu **More Options (ellipsis icon) > View public page**.
* The 'Test Embed' button shows a visual part of the document on a separate page.

## Import

There are two (2) ways to import a visualization to Vida. 

### Vida document format
Please visit <a href='https://github.com/vidalab/document_template' target='_blank'>Vida Document Template</a> for more details.

### Manually
Users need to follow Vida document format to enture proper imports. Please visit section **D3 Docuemnt / Editors**.

## Debug

### How to
Debugging a Vida d3 document is similar to debuging any javacript code. Chrome debugging console is recommended for this task.

The document code is inserted at the bottom of the each page. 
To set a break point any where within the code, developers can insert a 'debugger;' statement right before the wanted break point and then save the document.
By doing this, the Chrome console will automatically break when the re-execution happens.

### Safe Mode
Developers often find their code takes too long or even got stuck and unable to load or reload.
This is due to the javascript execution could not be completed. 
One common mistake is having the code running an infinite loop or a very long process.

Turning on the safe mode will help developers to fix these cases. This mode doesn't execute the javascript unless disabled again.

To turn on safe mode, go to **Home / D3 Documents** and from the document list select the bug icon on the target document.
Once the bug is lit up, loading the document again will not execute the javascript code.

To turn off this mode, document owner can click on the bug icon within the top menu bar to disable it. 
This option can be done similarly as turning on in the document list with the bug icon.

**Notes:**
* Canvas svg rendering will not run unless this mode is disabled.
* Enabling this will stop embed rendering.
