This tool is used to build datasets that can be used in Vida d3 documents and Google Charts. 
A dataset can be shared across multiple documents. 

To create a new chart, on home screen after login go to: **Datasets > New Dataset**

A dataset can be imported from a file or a data URL (JSON).

A dataset has similar privacy settings as a d3 document:
* Public
* Unlisted
* Private
